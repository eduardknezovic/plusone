# Plus One


At the time, the purpose of this project is to track 
the number of pushup user has done using Telegram Bot.

The bot is available @PlusOneRobot

It uses Telegram Bot to communicate the user and it
uses Sqlite (SQL) database. 

## Setup

It's recommended to create a virtual environment for projects, but 
it is not the necessary step.

### 0. Virtual Environment (Optional)

From this current folder, you may run these commands in terminal

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv # Creates a virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate # Activates the virtual environment
```

### 1. Set up dependencies

#### Install the required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Add the environment variables

In config.py file, there is the TELEGRAM_TOKEN variable.

There's the one that we're using for production, but you can
create your own telegram bot and use its token for local testing!,

Instructions available here: https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/telegram/create-telegram-chatbot
So, you'd just get the token and paste it in the config.py file.

In short:
- Go to telegram
- Send a message to @BotFather
- Create a new bot with /newbot command
- Copy the token and paste it in the config.py file

### 2. Running the program

From this current folder:

```bash
python main.py
```

If set up correctly, you will be able to send a 
"/pushups 10" message to bot, and it will respond accordingly.

## Unit testing

pytest is used for unit testing. It's already included in the requirements.txt file.

To run the unit tests, run this command from the current folder:

```bash
pytest test.py
```

## Database

The data is stored in the activities.db file. It's a sqlite database.

It can be opened and evaluated using DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

Or, you can use the command line to open it:

```bash
sqlite3 activities.db
```

Then, you can run SQL commands to query the data.

## The workflow

It's a common practice in the industry to 
create a new git branch for each feature.

Creating a new branch:
```
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

(Branch name can be a short description of the feature ie. "add-pushup-command")

After the feature is completed, it's pushed to the remote repository,
using the command:
```
git push
```

When pushing for the first time, you will be asked to set the upstream branch, like so:
```
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
```

After the branch is pushed, create a pull request on github.

By creating a pull request, youâ€™re requesting that someone reviews and approves your changes before they become final.

After the pull request is approved, the changes will get merged to the main branch, and shortly after that,
the changes will be deployed to the production server.
